#' @title Filtering DESeq2 results
#'
#' @description We could be in a position to carry out multiple filters on the results of the differential analysis, in order not to repeat all the deseq_analysis.R code which provides for the actual computation of the differential analysis, the filtering_DE.R function has been implemented to be able to filter the file(s) " * _allres.tsv " and generate all the folders and files associated with the specific filters applied.
#' @description The function automatically searches inside the folders where_results and outfolder the file(s) (See ?deseq_analysis()) "_allres.tsv" and generates folders and files in the same folders with the new filters for foldchange and pvalue respectively.
#' @param padj_threshold (Default = 0.05) Threshold value for adjusted p-value filtering.
#' @param log2FC_threshold (Default = 0) Threshold value for log2(Fold Change) filtering.
#' @param where_results (Default = "./") Folder in which the new output is written.
#' @param outfolder (Default = "results/") Name of the folder in which the new output is written.
#' @param save_excel (Default = FALSE) Write output in MS Excel file format (.xlsx).
