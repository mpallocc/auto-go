\title{Read enrichment results from tables}
\usage{
read_enrich_tables(
  where_results = "./",
  outfolder = "results/",
  log2FC_threshold = 0,
  padj_threshold = 0.05,
  which_list = c("up_genes", "down_genes", "up_down_genes", "everything"),
  from_DE_analysis = TRUE,
  where_files = NULL,
  files_format = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{where_results}{Specify the folder in which you want to save the outputs. Default is "./". Note: if you are working with RNotebook the default working directory, if not specified, is the folder in which the .Rmd file is saved.}

\item{outfolder}{The name to assign to the folder for output saving. (Default = "results/"). NOTE: please add "/" at the end.}

\item{log2FC_threshold}{Threshold value for log2(Fold Change) for considering genes as differentially expressed (default = 0).}

\item{padj_threshold}{Threshold value for adjusted p-value significance (Defaults to 0.05).}

\item{which_list}{One of c("up_genes","down_genes","up_down_genes","everything"). Select a list of genes to perform the enrichment. Respectively, only up regulated genes (up_genes), only down regulated genes (down_genes), both up and down regulated genes (up_down_genes), or everything allow to load all the three kind of lists separately.}

\item{from_DE_analysis}{Default is TRUE, set to FALSE if the lists you want to upload are not from a differential expression analysis.}

\item{where_files}{Default is NULL, when from_DE_analysis = T it is mandatory to provide a path to specify where the list of genes are.}

\item{files_format}{Default is NULL, when from_DE_analysis = T it is mandatory to provide the extension of the list of genes you want to upload.}
